Hi there 👋

I am currently working on:
- Building websites using CSS Frameworks

I am Learning how to:
- Properly use CSS Frameworks like Bulma and Tailwind
- Using Javascript to make my websites interactive

I am looking for help with:
- Understanding how to find answers to solutions faster.
- Knowing what to learn after HTML / CSS / JS

Ask me about:
- Physics (I like the subject)

How to reach me:
- E-mail me!: jurriaans.hugo@gmail.com

Fun fact:
- I used to like Graphic designing more that programming.
